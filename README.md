# Space Defender

> A take on the classic "old school" Arcade game Space Invader's
> The game has multiple levels with the Alien's getting smarter 
> and more numerous as the levels increase. You receive points for 
> every Alien ship you destroy but each shot also cost you points.
> When there are a few Alien's left they start tracking you and shooting
> directly at you. You can visualize the screen as 360 globe. Use the
> arrow keys to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Press the spacebar to fire.
> To pause the game just click out side the game or press the letter 'p'.
> Once the game is completed you have the option to provide your score
> if it is in the top 10 it will displayed on the toast.
>
> Enjoy!!!
